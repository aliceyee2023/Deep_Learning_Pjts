# mnist readme #
The MNIST dataset is a very large set of handwritten digits. The goal is to identify the correct digit. 
By using deep learning framework,I learn how to implement and train my first Artificial Neural Network.
It also teaches me how to do multiclass classification problems instead of just binary problems.

MNIST can be loaded directly from within TensorFlow and PyTorch.
